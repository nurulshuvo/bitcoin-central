<h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>
  Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency. Peer-to-peer means that there is no central authority to issue new money or keep track of transactions. Instead, these tasks are managed collectively by the nodes of the network. Advantages:
<ul>
  <li>
    Bitcoins can be sent easily through the Internet, without having to trust middlemen.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transactions are designed to be irreversible.
  </li>
  <li>
    Be safe from instability caused by fractional reserve banking and central banks. The limited inflation of the Bitcoin systemâ€™s money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) throughout the network, not monopolized by banks.
  </li>
</ul>
